## Summary about expertise and interests
My professional skills consist of experience in software development, science, teaching, project management, working as team lead and tech lead.

Software development is the biggest part of my experience. And at this moment I’d like to deal with client-server technologies (service-oriented architecture, distributed calculation system) based on python.

I have knowledge in hiring systems (and applicant tracking system), geodata processing, algorithms and data structure, optimization methods, and computational geometry. And it would be interesting to use information technology in such areas as robotics, construction, energetics and/or medicine.
